# Transformative Attendance System

Under the guidance of Dr. Vivekraj V K

## Objective

Traditional attendance tracking poses challenges such as time-consumption, errors, and inefficiency in large classes. Our innovative system seamlessly integrates cutting-edge computer vision models to address these issues.

## Scope

The system features:

- User-friendly app for faculty
- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Automated excel sheet population
- Detailed attendance analysis using graphs

## Challenges

1. Varying image quality based on faculty's mobile devices
2. Varied processing speeds on different devices
3. Model performance dependent on dataset diversity
   - Challenge in obtaining a diverse dataset due to privacy concerns

## Target Audience

Intended for schools and colleges, our system streamlines attendance tracking. A mobile app will be developed for faculty to capture, monitor, and analyze student attendance.

## Technology Stack

- React-Native / Flutter
- Google Sheets API
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
